            <p>
                When I'm not coding, I love to indulge in a few of my favorite hobbies. I'm a big anime fan and enjoy watching shows like Naruto and One Piece. I also enjoy playing video games.
                In addition to anime and gaming, I love spending time with my friends. I always cherish the time I spend with my close circle of friends.
